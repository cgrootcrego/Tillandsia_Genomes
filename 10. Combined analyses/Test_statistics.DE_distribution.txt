1. Test: Are DE gene counts per scaffold normally distributed in T. fasciculata:

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
	data:  merged_Tfas$DE_counts
	W = 0.98034, p-value = 0.8917

2. Test: Are DE gene counts per scaffold normally distributed in T. leiboldiana:

	Shapiro-Wilk normality test
	data:  merged_Tlei$DE_counts
	W = 0.90213, p-value = 0.01748

3. Test: Are per-scaffold DE gene counts correlated with scaffold size in T. fasciculata?

	Kendall's rank correlation tau
	data:  merged_Tfas$DE_counts and merged_Tfas$size
	z = 2.5478, p-value = 0.01084
	alternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0
	sample estimates:
	      tau
	0.3651637

4. Test: Are per-scaffold DE gene counts correlated with scaffold size in T. leiboldiana?

	Kendall's rank correlation tau
	data:  merged_Tlei$DE_counts and merged_Tlei$size
	z = 3.2054, p-value = 0.001349
	alternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0
	sample estimates:
	      tau
	0.4531803
